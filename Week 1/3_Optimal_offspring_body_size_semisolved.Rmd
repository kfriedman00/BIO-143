# Goal

The goal of this exercise is to show how we can leverage basic notions
of Malthusian growth to solve a typical trade-off problem on optimal
life history traits in ecology.

# The Problem

A common debate on life history strategies is whether it is better
producing many "small" offspring, each with small probability of
surviving to the juvenile/adult stage, or fewer "large" offspring, each
with more relevant probability of surviving.

Let's try to analyze this problem by using a simple demographic model of
a *semelparous*, asexual organism (so we do not have to deal with sex
ratio).

*As you will see, the problem will be formulated in terms of
maximization of the [finite growth rate]{.underline} of the population*

## Assumptions

We are going to make the following assumptions/definitions:

-   $\delta$ is the total biomass $$grams$$ invested in reproduction;

-   $x$ is the body size (biomass) of each offspring - therefore, the
    number of offspring produced by an adult individual is:
    ${\delta}/x$;

-   Offspring with body size $x$ smaller than ${\gamma}$ $$grams$$ are
    too small and die;

-   For offspring larger than ${\gamma}$ $$grams$$, chance of survival
    until maturity is an increasing and saturating function of body size
    $x$, as described by the following function: $$
          {\sigma} (x) = {\alpha} \cdot \frac{x - {\gamma}}{1+{\beta} * (x - {\gamma})}
    $$

Let's further assume that natural selection will favor the population
with the highest growth rate ${\lambda}$.

## Assignment

Assuming that:

-   $\delta = 30$ $$grams$$

-   $\alpha = 0.1$ $$grams^-1^$$

-   $\gamma = 1.00$ $$grams$$

-   $\beta = 0.25$ $$grams^-1^$$

**compute numerically (and, if you are able, analytically) the optimal
body mass of offspring and the corresponding number of offspring**

## Hint:

-   First, draw qualitatively (by hand on paper!) the graph of survival
    $\sigma(x)$ as a function of offspring size $x$.
-   Then, derive and draw the qualitative graph of the population finite
    growth rate as a function of body mass $x$.
-   We will then use R to *plot* the graphs of $\sigma$ and $\lambda$ as
    a function of $x$
-   We will find (visually, numerically and analytically) the optimal
    offspring body weight $x_{opt}$.
-   You will explore which of the 4 parameters (alpha, beta, gamma,
    delta) has the most influence on $x_{opt}$.

# Solutions

## Qualitative solution

Say $N_k$ the number of adult individuals in generation $k$.

If $x$ is offspring's mean body size, the total number of offspring
generated is equal to: $$
    Offspring_k = \frac{\delta}{x} \cdot N_k
$$ the number of offspring that survival to become reproductive adult in
the generation $k+1$ is this equal to:

$$
    N_{k+1} = \sigma(x) \cdot Offspring_k 
$$ Therefore: $$
    N_{k+1} = \sigma(x) \cdot \frac{\delta}{x} \cdot N_k
$$

and thus, the finite growth rate of the population is equal to:

$$
    \lambda(x) = \sigma(x) \cdot \frac{\delta}{x}
$$

Therefore, the finite groth rate $\lambda$ is the product of two
functions, $\sigma(x)$, which is an increasing and saturating function
of body size $x$, and: $$
\frac{\delta}{x}
$$ which is a (hyperbolic) decreasing function of body size $x$.

Note that $\lambda$ is equal to zero when $x \leq 1$ and it go to $0$
for $x \rightarrow \infty$, it is the product of two positive function
for $x>1$. Therefore, $\lambda$ is an humped function, which increases
with $x$, reaches a maximum and then decreases for larger values of body
size $x$. We thus expect that there is a value of $x$ that maximize the
finite growth rate.

Let's find this value, first graphically (by plotting the function
$\lambda$), then numerically (and, if you want, you can try to find the
analytic solution).

## Graphical solution

Let's first set model parameters and their value in R, namely:

```{r }
alpha <- # Replace with correct value
gamma <- # Replace with correct value
beta  <- # Replace with correct value
delta <- # Replace with correct value
```

We could easily set a value to body size $x$ and compute the fraction
$\sigma$ of offspring of body size $x$ surviving to maturity, for
instance:

```{r }
x  <- 4 * gamma; x  

sigma5 <- alpha*((x - gamma)/(1+beta*(x - gamma))); sigma5
```

As the number of offspring is:

```{r }
# Replace with correct expression to print out the number of offspring
```

therefore, the finite growth rate is

```{r }
(delta/x) * sigma5
```

Of course, this is not a really efficient use of R. We can set a range
of values of body size $x$, between, say, 0 and 10 times $\gamma$ (we
could go higher, up to 30 gram, but as we will see, this is more than
enough)

```{r }
size <- seq(gamma/100, 10 * gamma, by = gamma/100) # we do not start from zero
head(size)  # check the first elements of this vector  
```

and then we can define a function to compute sigma ($\sigma(x)$) as
function of body size $x$, namely:

```{r }
f.sigma <-  function(x) {
  if (x <= gamma) {
    # Fill in the return function with what we should return if x <= gamma
    return()
  }else{
    return( alpha*((x-gamma)/(1+beta*(x-gamma))) )
  }
} 


sigma  <-  f.sigma(size)

tail(sigma) # check the last elements of this vector
```

Now, let's plot ($\sigma(x)$) as a function body size $x$:

```{r }
# This is the more "traditional" form of plotting in R, rather than ggplot.
# Read this as:
# - Plot one plot
# - Plot sigma as a function of size (with a bunch of desired characteristics of our plot)
# - Plot a vertical line at x = gamma

par(mfrow=c(1,1)) # This tells the output we want a 1x1 grid of plots (i.e. just one plot)
plot(sigma ~ size, type="l", cex=0.5, xlim=c(0,max(size)), xlab = 'body size x [grams]',
                         ylab = 'annual survival', lwd = 3)
abline(v=gamma, lty = 3) 
```

Now, let's compute the average number of offspring with body size $x$
and plot is on semi-log scale:

```{r }
f.offspring.no  <-  function (x) delta/x  

offspring.no  <- f.offspring.no(size)
head(offspring.no)

plot(#Replace this with the correct expression in order to plot the number of offspring by size,
    cex=0.5, type="l", log = 'y')
```

Now, we can finally compute the finite growth rate $\lambda$ as product
of number of offspring on body size $x$ and their survival $\sigma$ to
reproduction, which in r is particularly easy to do, as the
multiplication operator "\*" multiply the two vectors element by
element, that is:

```{r }
lambda <- offspring.no * sigma  

head(sigma)
head(offspring.no)
head(lambda)

plot(lambda ~ size, cex=0.5, type="l")
abline(h=1, lty = 3) # add a horizontal line for lambda=1 (by the way, why lambda=1?)
```

Therefore, we can see that $\lambda$ is indeed an unimodal function of
body size $x$ with a maximum for a body size between 2.5 and 3.5

We can find numerically the value of $x$ that maximizes $\lambda$ as
follows:

```{r }
size[which(lambda == max(lambda))] 
```

## Analytic solution

Note that this value is probably the right one (as we designed the
exercise so that $\lambda$ is maximum for $x=3$). Yet, this result
depends upon how finely we set the vector *size* of body sizes with R's
*seq()* function

We can derive analytically the optimal body size by noting that when
$\lambda$ reaches its maximum value, there its first derivative is equal
to zero by definition.

Therefore, we should find the value of $x$ for which:

$$
 \frac{d{\lambda(x)}}{dx} \equiv  0
$$

As $\lambda(x) = \sigma(x) \cdot Offspring(x)$ (actually, let's rename
$G(x) \equiv Offspring(x)$, this means:

$$
 \frac{d{\lambda(x)}}{dx} = \frac{d{\sigma(x) \cdot G(x)} }{dx} = \frac{d{\sigma(x)} }{dx} \cdot G(x) + \sigma(x) \cdot \frac{d{G(x)} }{dx} \equiv  0
$$ or also: $$
{\alpha} \frac{1 + \beta (x - \gamma) - (x - \gamma) \beta}{(1 + \beta(x - \gamma))^2} \cdot \frac{\delta}{x} + \alpha \frac{x - \gamma}{1+\beta * (x - \gamma)} \cdot  \left( -\frac{\delta}{x^2} \right)  \equiv  0
$$ which can be simplified to: $$
 {\beta}(x - \gamma)^2 = \gamma
$$ and, thus, the optimal body size is: $$
 x_0 = \gamma + \sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{\beta}}
$$

Therefore,

```{r }
x.opt = gamma + sqrt(gamma/beta); x.opt
```

# some minor (but cool) addition

## Using R for symbolic calculation

In case you might not remember all the derivative rules, R can help you
by doing symbolic calculation, and here below we will show you how.

Specifically, we will make R to compute the derivative of lambda with
respect to body size and then use *uniroot()* to find where the
derivative is equal to zero.

First we transform the function to compute $\lambda$ to a "text
expression" in R, namely:

```{r }
lambda.expr <- expression(alpha*((x-gamma)/(1+beta*(x-gamma))) * delta/x)
lambda.expr 
```

Then, we simply ask R to compute the derivative for us:

```{r }
lambda.der <- D(lambda.expr, "x")

lambda.der
```

The result is a text expression as well, so we need to tell R to
*evaluate* it for any value of model parameters and for the specific
value of body size, namely:

```{r }
f.lambda.der = function(x) eval(lambda.der) 
f.lambda.der
```

Let's see whether the numerical derivative is indeed quite close to
zero:

```{r }
f.lambda.der(x.opt)
```

Let's compute and then plot the derivative of $\lambda$ as a function of
body size $x$

```{r }
lambda.der.v = sapply(size, f.lambda.der)
plot(lambda ~ size, cex=0.5, col="blue")
abline(v=c(gamma, 20*gamma), h=0, lty = 3)
abline(v=x.opt, col="red")
```

## Plot all three graphs on the same plot

plot several function each with its scale on the same panel par(mfrow
=c(1,1), mar=c(6,4,1,8)) set margin size to accomodate two y axes on
right

```{r }
par(mfrow =c(1,1), mar=c(6,4,1,8)) # set margin size to accomodate two y axes on right
plot(sigma ~ size, type="l", cex=0.5, col="green", lwd=2, xlim=c(0,10*gamma))
leg.txt <- c("Sigma", "Offspring number", "Lambda")
legend(0.0004, 0.000004, leg.txt, col=c("green", "red", "blue"), lty=1, 
       lwd=2, bty="n")


par(new=T)  #par adds new data to prior plot without overwriting it
plot(offspring.no ~ size, axes = F, cex=0.5, col="red", ylab="", lwd=2, 
     type="l", xlim=c(0,10*gamma))

axis(4)  #position 4 is the right side of the quartz window
mtext("Offspring number", side = 4, line=-2) # 'line' adjusts position of axis label

par(new=T)  #par adds new data to prior plot without overwriting it
plot(lambda ~ size, axes = F, cex=0.5, col="blue", type = 'l', ylab="", lwd=2,  
     xlim=c(0,10*gamma))

axis(4, line=4)  #position 4 is the right side of the quartz window
mtext("Lambda", side = 4, line=6)  

abline(v=x.opt, col="black", lty=2)
```

## Find optimal body size by using R's uniroot() function

Lastly, I just want to note that in case we were unable to derive the
analytic solution, we could still find the solution numerically by using
R's *uniroot()* function to find the value of $x$ for which the
derivative of $\lambda$ is equal to zero, namely:

```{r }
obs <- uniroot(f.lambda.der, c(gamma, 10*gamma), tol = 10^-12)  
opt.body.size = obs[1];opt.body.size 		
```
