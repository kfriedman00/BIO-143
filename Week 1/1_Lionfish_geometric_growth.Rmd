# Goals

* Here we will use *R* and *RMarkdown* to simulate Malthusian growth for a 
population of lionfish *Pterois miles* and *P. volitans* in the Caribbean.

* This exercise is intended also to be a smooth introduction to R if you are not 
familiar with this programming environment.

* We will thus learn how to simulate the dynamics for a population for which the 
finite growth rate is known and to plot the outcome in natural and semi-log 
scale.

* We will also learn how to estimate the mean time the population takes on 
average to double in size

> Invasive lionfish, *Pterois miles* and *P. volitans*, are now established
along the southeast coast of the United States and parts of the Caribbean
(Morris et al. 2009; Schofield et al. 2009). Lionfish represent the first marine
reef fish invader to this region and are thought to have been released
intentionally by aquarists over many years (Courtenay 1995; Morris and Whitfield
2009). The rapidity of the lionfish invasion in the Western North Atlantic and
Caribbean is unprecedented among marine fishes. Not only are invasive lionfish
now widely distributed geographically, in some locations that are one of the
most abundant reef fishes (Green and Coˆte´ 2009). Lionfish have the potential
to significantly affect the trophic structure of reef communities (Albins and
Hixon 2008). As generalist piscivores (Morris and Akins 2009), lionfish could
compete with native reef fishes of the snapper-grouper complex, a group of
fishes that have been heavily exploited (Coleman et al. 1999). This competition
could hamper current efforts to rebuild overfished stocks.

Quoting from *Whitfield et al.* (2007, [Biological Invasions](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10530-006-9005-9 "Link to the paper on Springer web site") ):

> More recently the Indo-Pacific lionfish (*Pterois volitans/* *P. miles*
complex) has become established along the southeastern region of the United
States. A combination of verified and unverified reports suggest that the
lionfish distribution may be continuous from Miami, Florida north to Cape
Hatteras, North Carolina (26\_ N--35\_ N), in water depths of 30--100 m,
including Bermuda (personal communication, Judi Clee, Sarah Manuel), (Whitfield
et al. 2002; Hare and Whitfield 2003; Semmens et al. 2004; Ruiz-Carus et al.
2006). Juveniles have also been sporadically reported off the coast of New
Jersey, Long Island and Rhode Island, during late summer and fall, but
overwintering survival is not expected due to cold water temperatures (Kimball
et al. 2004). These data and observations strongly suggest that lionfish are
firmly established, reproducing (Ruiz-Carus et al. 2006) and their population is
growing along the Atlantic coast. Nevertheless, this apparent increase in
lionfish distribution could be a function of greater public awareness and
reporting. Quantitative abundance measures are necessary to understand the true
status of the lionfish population and to evaluate potential impacts to native
communities.

## Assignment

1) Assuming that 
* the lionfish population increases by ~12% on average every year
according to *Morris et al.* (2011, [*Biological Invasions*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10530-010-9786-8 "Link to the original paper on Springer web site") )
* the observed density in 2004 was two individuals/ha

> plot the projected population density as a function of time from 2004 to 2024
and comment about the resulting population trend.

2) Now, plot the population growth in a semi-logarithmic scale (log of population
density on thge vertical axis): how does the population trend look like 
in this case?

3) How long does the population take to double in size? and to increase by a factor
of 10?

4) Lastly, according to Whitfield et al. (2007, *Biological Invasions*), 
the lionfish had already reached a population density \~21.2 individuals/ha in 
shallower North Caroline coastal surveys at the time they conducted their study.

Based on what reported by Morris about the finite growth rate of the population, 
how long did the population take to increase from 2 to 22.1ind/ha?

# Solution

First, let's clear R's memory. 

```{r clean}
rm(list=ls(all=TRUE)) 
```

The growth rate of lion fish was derived from *Morris et al.* (2011, [*Biological Invasions*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10530-010-9786-8 "Link to the original paper on Springer web site") ):

```{r}
lambda  <- 1.12
```

Assume the current number of individuals per hectare is still very low, 
at the beginning of the invasion, for instance:

```{r}
N0  <- 2.0 
```

We can use R to calculate lionfish density in the next generation:

```{r}
N2  <- lambda * N0; N2
```

Needless to say, this is certainly not an efficient use of R, we can do better
than this: for instance, compute lionfish density in 10 generations:

```{r}
N10 <- (lambda^10)*N0; sprintf("%.2f", N10) # print only two significant digits
```

In this case we have the analytic formula to derive lionfish density at any
future generation. In general, however, model complexity requires to work with a
recursive formula, one step at a time. Let's see how we do it. We need to write
a "for loop" to compute number of individuals in the population at time *t+1* as
a function of population at time *t*.

Let's first set time horizon (for instance, 20 years):

```{r}
tmax <-  20 
```

We also create a vector to store pop. abundance at time *t*, with length *tmax*, namely:

```{r}
nt <- numeric(tmax) 
```

Let's assign the initial population density to the first element of this vector

```{r}
nt[1] <- N0 
```

### for loop to simulate the dynamics with a recursive equation

Here is the simple *for* loop

```{r}
for (t in 1:(tmax-1)) {

  nt[t+1] <- lambda * nt[t]
	
}
```

We can print on screen the first elements of the vector

```{r}
sprintf("%.2f", head(nt))
```

and the last ones"

```{r}
sprintf("%.2f", tail(nt))
```

...or extract any element form the vector at a time point

```{r}
sprintf("%.2f", c(nt[1], nt[5], nt[15]))

```

### simple plot in R by using ggplot2()

Anyway, it might be useful just to plot the result, i.e., population density vs time. To do so, we need to (1) install the ggplo2 package (if you haven't install it yet), (2) load the package, (3) create a *data frame*, as shown hereafter:

```{r}
if (!require("ggplot2")) install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

df <- data.frame(years=1:tmax, density=nt)
```

and then design and render the plot:

```{r}
ggplot() +
geom_step(data=df,  mapping=aes(x=years, y=nt)) +  # set the set wise geometry
geom_point(data=df, mapping=aes(x=years, y=nt ), color="red") + #the red points
geom_line(data=df, mapping=aes(x=years, y=nt ), color = "darkgrey", linetype=3) + # a dotted line
  ggtitle("Population trend") +  # the tite
  xlab("Time [years]") + ylab("Density [ind./ha]") # the axis label

```

## Question: how does the population trajectory look like in a semi-logarithmic scale?

On a semi-log scale

```{r}
ggplot() +
geom_step(data=df,  mapping=aes(x=years, y=nt)) +
geom_point(data=df, mapping=aes(x=years, y=nt ), color="red") +
geom_line(data=df, mapping=aes(x=years, y=nt ), color = "darkgrey", linetype=3) +
  ggtitle("Population trend") +
  xlab("Time [years]") + ylab("Density [ind./ha]") +
   scale_y_log10() 
```

# How log does the population take to double in size?

To compute the expected number of generations the population is projected to take on average to double in size, we can use the following equation:

$$
N_{x} =  2N_0 = {\lambda}^x  N_0
$$ where the generation $x$ is the unknown parameter. Solving this equation is quite trivial, we can first divide each member of the equation by $N_0$ (>0):

$$
2 = {\lambda}^x
$$

and then take the natural logarithm:

$$
\log 2 = \log {\lambda}^x = x \cdot \log{\lambda}
$$

which can be solved for *x* as:

$$
x = \frac{\log 2}{\log({\lambda})}
$$

Therefore, the doubling time \[years\] is:

```{r}
DT <- log(2)/log(lambda)
sprintf("%.1f", DT)

```

According to Whitfield et al. (2007, *Biological Invasions*), lionfish had reached a population density \~21.2 individuals/ha in shallower North Caroline coastal surveys at the time they conducted their study.

Based on what we know about the finite growth rate of the population, how long did the population take to increase from 2 to 22.1ind/ha?
